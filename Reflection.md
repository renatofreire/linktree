# AI usage

For this project, I used two AI tools:

- GitHub Copilot: Assisted in generating some types and repetitive functions, such as those in the service folder. It was also helpful for general code completion.

- ChatGPT: Helped identify and resolve a bug that was preventing deployment.

# Work Done Without AI

The database schema was designed manually, specifically tailored for this project, without the use of prompts.

The applicationâ€™s architecture and folder structure were not influenced by AI. I followed patterns I had used in previous projects.

Additionally, AI suggestions were not always the best solution. In some cases, such as defining certain types or generating HTML structures for components, they did not solve the problem effectively.

# Areas for Improvement

Given more time, the first thing I would prioritize is writing tests.

Another important area that needs improvement is error handling, to make the application more robust and resilient.
